# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Surf Ceylon specifics

- Map: Set your Mapbox token via an environment variable before starting the app:

   Windows PowerShell
   ```powershell
   $env:EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN = "<your_mapbox_public_token>"; npx expo start
   ```

- Backend API: Make sure the backend is running on port 3000.
   - From `surfapp--backend`:
      ```powershell
      npm install
      npm run dev
      ```
   - The mobile app will call `http://10.0.2.2:3000` on Android emulators and `http://127.0.0.1:3000` elsewhere by default.
